I am a PhD student at the School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh. My advisor is [Dr. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/), and I belong to [PITT Computational Social Dynamics Lab (PICSO LAB)](https://picsolab.github.io/). I am a data scienctist that interested in asking "Why and how machine makes such predictions?". Therefore, I mostly focus on developing interpretable machine learning algorithms or make algorithms explainable to enable humans to understand the model and further improve them. Previously, I do some projects and publish papers about how to apply machine learning algorithms to the medical field. Currently, I work with Dr. Yu-Ru Lin and some computational social science projects aim to understand human factors from data.
